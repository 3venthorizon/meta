# Project Meta
Project Meta is an hobbyist alternative collection of libraries to challenge conventional implementation efficiency and architecture design.

Alternative, because the wheel has been invented, but not all wheels race down hill to cross the finish line at the same time.

## Why?
It is for the challenge to reproduce design excellence. 

Complex problems are often met with complex and brute force solutions. It is almost considered an art to create a simple solution to a complicated problem. This project is for the love of coding software to explore new possibilities.

## How?
By keeping the best in software design and code style practices, but break away from convention to shed the bloatware.

## What are the goals?
Simplicity through:

* Reusability.
* Light weight:
    * Clean and readable code.
    * System resource footprint.
